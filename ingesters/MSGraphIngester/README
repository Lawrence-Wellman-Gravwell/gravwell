# Microsoft Graph Security Client

Pulls alerts & security scores from the MS Graph API.

## Setup

Register a new application with Azure AD. Give it SecurityActions.ReadAll and SecurityEvents.ReadAll permissions. Generate an authentication token and save it.

In the config file, set `Client-ID` to the "Application (client) ID" for the app, set `Client-Secret` to the auth token you just generated, and set `Tenant-Domain` to your domain (e.g. "gravwell.onmicrosoft.com").

Set up one or more ContentType definitions. The following types are available: "alerts", "secureScores", and "controlProfiles".

Your configuration should end up looking something like this:

```
Client-ID=4d2066ab-7ac8-4b4c-ba62-b4e7ca2b1de6
Client-Secret="replaceme"
Tenant-Domain=gravwell.onmicrosoft.com

[ContentType "alerts"]
	Content-Type="alerts"
	Tag-Name="graph-alerts"

[ContentType "scores"]
	Content-Type="secureScores"
	Tag-Name="graph-scores"

[ContentType "profiles"]
	Content-Type="controlProfiles"
	Tag-Name="graph-profiles"
```
