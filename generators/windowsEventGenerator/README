Note that this is different from the other generators in the repository. This tool is intended to be run on a Windows system. It generates Windows event logs, which can be ingested using the separate winevent ingester.

The events end up in the Application channel. The default event source is called 'GravwellEventGenerator'. The EventIDs are random numbers between 1 and 9999, and the generator randomly picks between Info, Warning, and Error for the event severity level.

Flags:

-source-name <srcname>: Set the event source name. Default "GravwellEventGenerator".
-event-count <n>: Specify how many events to generate. Default 100.
-stream: If set, the generator will run indefinitely, generating event-count events every second until killed.

To build:

GOOS=windows go build

To run (on a Windows system):

windowsEventGenerator.exe

windowsEventGenerator -event-count 10000

windowsEventGenerator -stream -event-count 10 -source-name MyEventSource
